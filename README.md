## Install

```shell
$ npm install -D cypress-data-session
# or using Yarn
$ yarn add -D cypress-data-session
```

Import this package from the spec or from the support file

```js
// cypress/support/index.js
import 'cypress-data-session'
```

If you plan to use the [shareAcrossSpecs](#shareacrossspecs) option, you need to load this plugin from your plugin file

### v10

```js
// cypress.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress'

export default defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      require('cypress-data-session/src/plugin')(on, config)
    },
  },
})
```

### v9

```js
// cypress/plugin/index.js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  require('cypress-data-session/src/plugin')(on, config)
}
```

### Types

If using JavaScript, point the spec at this package using the `///` comment

```js
// cypress/integration/spec.js
/// <reference types="cypress-data-session" />
```

See [src/index.d.ts](./src/index.d.ts)

## Use

You can call `cy.dataSession` with simple 3 arguments or with an options object that allows you to pass more options.

### three arguments

```js
cy.dataSession(sessionName, setupFunction, validateValueFunction)
```

This example comes from [cypress/integration/spec.js](./cypress/integration/spec.js)

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  // let's say you want to set up the value "A"
  cy.dataSession(
    'A', // data name
    () => 'a', // data creation commands
    (x) => x === 'a', // data validation function
  )
})

it('has object A', () => {
  expect(Cypress.getDataSession('A')).to.equal('a')
})
```

The value is automatically added as an alias, so you can use `function () { ... }` syntax for the test callback and access the above value using `this.A` property

```js
it('exists under an alias', function () {
  expect(this.A).to.equal('a')
})
```

Note: if the `setup` function's text changes, the session is recomputed.

### validate

The `validate` predicate can use Cypress commands, but must ultimately yield a boolean value.

```js
// validate a room id by fetching it from the database
// using cy.task and finding the room
const validate = (id) => {
  return cy.task('getRooms', null, { log: false }).then((rooms) => {
    // important: make sure to return a Boolean
    // otherwise _.find returns undefined
    // and Cypress cy.then callback returns the previous value
    return Boolean(Cypress._.find(rooms, { _id: id }))
  })
}
```

The `validate` function is optional. If you skip it, the `setup` will be run every time.

```js
// without "validate" function, the "setup" runs every time
cy.dataSession(name, setup)
```

You can also pass a boolean value, which is useful during debugging.

```js
validate: true // no need to recompute the value, it is still valid
validate: false // call setup again
```

See [cypress/integration/validate.js](./cypress/integration/validate.js) spec.

### onInvalidated

You can pass a function as the last argument to the `cy.dataSession` to be called if the "validate" returns false. This function will be called _before_ the "setup" function executes.

```js
function onInvalidated() {
  // clear user session for example
}
cy.dataSession(name, setupUser, validateUser, onInvalidated)
```

See an example in the spec [cypress/integration/invalidate.js](./cypress/integration/invalidate.js) and video [Invalidate cy.session From cypress-data-session](https://youtu.be/SyDz6l_EFoc).

### Options object

You can pass multiple parameters using a single options object, see [cypress/integration/options.js](./cypress/integration/options.js)

```js
cy.dataSession({
  name: 'C',
  setup: () => 'c',
  validate: (x) => x === 'c',
})
```

### recreate

Using the options object you can pass another function to be called after the `validate` yields true. This function let's you to perform Cypress commands with the validated value to "finish" the recreation. For example, you could visit the page after setting the cookie from the data session to end on the page, just like the `setup` does.

```js
cy.dataSession({
  name: 'logged in',
  setup: () => {
    // create user, visit the page, log in
    // let's say we are on the page '/home
    // save the cookie in the data session
    cy.getCookie('connect.sid')
  },
  // assume the cookie is valid
  validate: (c) => true,
  recreate (cookie) => {
    cy.setCookie(cookie)
    cy.visit('/home')
  }
})
```

### shareAcrossSpecs

By default, the data session value is saved inside `Cypress.env` object. This object is reset whenever the spec gets reloaded (think Cmd+R press or the full browser reload). The object is gone when the `cypress run` finishes with a spec and opens another one. If you want the data value to persist across the browser reloads, or be shared across specs, use the `shareAcrossSpecs: true` option.

```js
cy.dataSession({
  name: 'shared value',
  setup: () => 'a',
  validate: (x) => x === 'a',
  shareAcrossSpecs: true,
})
```

The first spec that creates it, saves it in the plugin file process. Then other specs can re-use this value (after validation, of course).

### preSetup

Sometimes you might need to run a few steps before the `setup` commands. While you could have these commands inside the `setup` function, it might make clear to anyone reading the code that these commands are preparing the data for the `setup` function. For example, you could check if the user you are about to create exists already and needs to be deleted first.

```js
cy.dataSession({
  name: 'user',
  preSetup() {
    cy.task('findUser', 'Joe').then((user) => {
      if (user) {
        cy.task('deleteUser', user._id)
      }
    })
  },
  setup() {
    // create the user "Joe"
  },
  validate(saved) {
    // check if the user "Joe" exists
  },
})
```

### dependsOn

A data session can depend on another data session or even multiple data sessions. For example, the data session "logged in user" can depend on the "created user" data session. If the "parent" session changes, we need to recompute all sessions that depend on it.

```js
cy.dataSession({
  name: 'created user',
  setup() {
    // create a user
  },
})

cy.dataSession({
  name: 'logged in user',
  dependsOn: 'created user',
  setup() {
    // take the user object from
    // the data session "created user"
    // and log in
  },
})
```

If the "created user" gets invalidated and recomputed (its `setup` method runs again), then the data session "logged in user" is invalidated automatically.

To list dependencies on multiple data sessions, pass an array of names

```js
dependsOn: ['first', 'second', 'third']
```

### init

Sometimes the data is generated, but sometimes we want to first see if we can load / initialize it the very first time (when there is nothing in the cache). This is where the `init` callback is useful. For example, let's say we are creating a special test user using the method `setup` and store its ID in the cache.

```js
cy.dataSession({
  name: 'test user',
  setup() {
    cy.task('createUser') // yields the user ID
  },
  validate: Cypress._.isString,
})
```

But what happens if there is a test user already created by the previous tests? The very first time we run the data session, we want to check if there is a test user, and if it exists, store its ID and NOT call the `setup` function. Thus we add the `init` function

```js
cy.dataSession({
  ...
  init () {
    cy.task('findUser', 'test user') // yields the ID if found
  }
})
```

The above example will find the test user (by calling the `cy.task`) the very first time the command runs, since there is nothing in the data session yet. Then it validates the ID. If there is no ID, it runs the `setup` function to create the test user. If there is a test user, and it returned the ID from the `init` method, then it is cached (as if the `setup` method created it), and the test continues.

### fetch the current data session value

You can simply request the current data session, if any

```js
cy.dataSession('sessionName').then(value => {
  ...
})
```

If the data session is not found in memory, it tries to fetch it from the plugins space (maybe it is shared across specs). If still not found, it throws an error.

## Flow

Consider the `cy.dataSession(options)` where the `options` object might have the following method callbacks: `validate`, `init`, `setup`, `preSetup`, `recreate`, and `onInvalidated`. Your case might provide just some of these callback functions, but let's say you have provided all of them. Here is how they will be called.

- First, the code pulls cached data for the session name.
- if there is no cached value:
  - it calls the `init` method, which might return a value
  - if there is a value, and it passes `validate` callback
    - it saves the value in the data session and finishes
    - else it needs to generate the real value and save it
      - it calls `preSetup` and `setup` methods and saves the value
- else (there is a cached value):
  - it calls `validate` with the cached value
  - if the `validate` returns `true`, the code calls `recreate` method
  - else it has to recompute the value, so it calls `onInvalidated`, `preSetup`, and `setup` methods

## Examples

- [bahmutov/chat.io](https://github.com/bahmutov/chat.io)

## Global methods

A few global utility methods are added to the `Cypress` object for accessing the data sessions. These methods are mostly utilities used internally.

- `Cypress.getDataSession(name)`
- `Cypress.getDataSessionDetails(name)`
- `Cypress.getSharedDataSessionDetails(name)`
- `Cypress.clearDataSession(name)`
- `Cypress.clearDataSessions()`
- `Cypress.dataSessions(enable)`
- `Cypress.setDataSession(name, value)`
- `Cypress.formDataSessionKey(name)`
- `Cypress.printSharedDataSessions`

### getDataSession

Returns the data for the session with the given name (if any).

### getDataSessionDetails

Returns the session with data and internal details, useful for debugging. If the session is not in memory, but stored in the plugin process, use `getSharedDataSessionDetails`.

### getSharedDataSessionDetails

Fetches the session details from the plugin process.

### dataSessions

Without any arguments, this static method lists all current data sessions.

### clearDataSessions

Clears all current data sessions from memory.

### clearDataSession

Clears the given data session from memory, from aliases, and from the plugin space (if shared). If running inside a test, automatically runs inside `cy.then` to be part of the command chain. Can be used from the DevTools console

```js
cy.dataSession('user', ...)
// rest of cy commands
// remove the data session "user"
Cypress.clearDataSession('user')
```

## Migration

### from v1 to v2

The default value for the `validate` option changed from `false` to `true`, meaning any non-nil value is valid and does not require to be recomputed.

```js
// v1
cy.dataSession(name, setup, true)
// v2
cy.dataSession(name, setup)
```

Same for the option form

```js
// v1
cy.dataSession({
  name,
  setup,
  validate: true,
})
// v2
cy.dataSession({
  name,
  setup,
})
```

If you previously set `validate` to false, keep it the same

```js
// v1, v2
cy.dataSession(name, setup, false)
```

## Debugging

This plugin uses [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug#readme) module to output verbose messages. Start Cypress with the environment variable `DEBUG=cypress-data-session` to see the messages in the terminal. From a Linux terminal we can use:

```shell
$ DEBUG=cypress-data-session npx cypress open
```

**Tip:** read how to set the system environment variables on different operating systems [here](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html)

To see the verbose log messages in the Cypress browser, open the DevTools and in the top window context set the local storage property

```js
localStorage.debug = 'cypress-data-session'
```

Make sure the "verbose" logs are visible. Then you should see the debug logs while the plugin executes its code in the browser, just like this image shows:
